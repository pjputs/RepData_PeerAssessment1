## Loading and preprocessing the data
Data is loaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip
```{r}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
cleanact <- activity[!is.na(activity$steps),]
perday<-count(cleanact,"date","steps") # requires library(plyr)
hist(perday[,2], main="Histogram of Steps per Day", xlab="Steps per Day", col="green")
mean(perday[,2])
median(perday[,2])
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r}
ag<-aggregate(steps ~ interval,data=activity, mean)
plot(ag,type="l")
ags<-sort.list(ag[,2], decreasing=TRUE)
ag[ags[1],1]
```

## Imputing missing values










## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
